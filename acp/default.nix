# The ACP agent `selfflowy serve` spawns. npm is the only channel the
# adapter ships through, so it gets the npins treatment: a committed
# lockfile in acp/, one fixed-output derivation (npmDepsHash) for the
# tarballs, nothing fetched at build time and no npx at run time.
# Regenerate after bumping acp/package.json:
#   cd acp && npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts
#   set npmDepsHash to lib.fakeHash, build, paste the hash it prints.
# The lockfile names a prebuilt `claude` for every platform npm knows
# about, so the deps FOD is ~640M and the hash is the same on every
# system; `npm ci` then keeps only the host's copy (~300M installed).
