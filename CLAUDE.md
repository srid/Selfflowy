# CLAUDE.md

Read README.md and docs/*.md first. This file is only what you can't infer.

## HARD RULES

* Personal outline DATA lives outside the repo: `$SELFFLOWY_HOME`
  (default `~/Dropbox/Selfflowy-Srid/`) — `Tasks.rkt`, `Daily.rkt`,
  `Roadmap.rkt`. NEVER commit those. NEVER invent content for them; treat
  them as user-owned. Re-validate after any edit. `examples/` is demo
  fiction only (e.g. `examples/Daily.rkt` + fragments); CI uses examples
  only, never Dropbox paths.
* No hand-rolling where a maintained library exists. In use: racket/cmdline,
  json (write-json/read-json), xml (xexprs), gregor (dates), markdown
  (title/note formatting in the web view only).
* No ANSI. Human view is the web app: `selfflowy serve` (routes in
  docs/cli.md; `just serve` / `just run` / `just watch` all launch it).
  Agents use `--json` (and `tree`, which is JSON-only).
* The LANGUAGE is the only validator (closed grammar): one checker
  (lang/graph) runs over a module's syntax at compile time, and over the whole
  spliced tree at run time when it has `@include`s (cross-file anchors exist
  only after the splice). Same rules, same messages, both ways. Readers just
  translate to (t ...) forms. Never validate in the reader, the CLI, the
  store, or the web layer.
* Agents are the primary CLI users: every command gets --json where it makes
  sense; errors are JSON on stderr in --json mode; exit codes are contract
  (see docs/cli.md). JSON fields are append-only within a "version".
* Error messages carry file:line:col of the OFFENDING form. srcloc fidelity
  has tests; keep them passing.
* Module boundaries ship with `contract-out` (flat, cheap checks — never a
  tree walk); blame + srcloc are part of the error contract, and have tests.
* Markdown is render-time only (web view). Strings in the struct/JSON stay
  verbatim.
* Code organization/review: https://kolu.dev/blog/hickey-lowy/ — separate
  spatial (complected concepts, Hickey) and temporal (volatility mismatches,
  Lowy) passes; ship only when both lenses go quiet.

## LAYERING

* lang/ readers -> lang/expander (t forms, closed grammar) -> task struct
* main.rkt exports data model + pure queries + web render. CLI is app code,
  not library. Pure logic takes `today` as an argument (testable, no clocks).
* Writes live in ops.rkt (add/done/move/daily -> result struct, or an
  exn:fail:op naming a kind). cli.rkt is a shell: parse, call an op, render,
  map kind -> exit code. The web mutation routes will call the same ops.
* Node keys are minted in the load layer, not the expander (see docs/cli.md);
  store.rkt owns snapshots and binds mirror sites before anything draws them.
* Live view is three parts in web/, none of which knows the others: store
  (what the outlines ARE), watch.rkt (WHEN they moved), events.rkt (a generic
  SSE hub: event names + payload strings, no outline vocabulary). serve.rkt is
  the only place they meet.
* The ACP bridge is web/acp.rkt: one subprocess, one turn at a time, chat
  frames out through that same hub. Nothing else spells "session/prompt".
* Core must build without web/: file naming is selfflowy/paths (file-label,
  key-label), not a renderer helper.
* JSON is two modules, two version counters: json/model (what a node/tree IS,
  durable) and json/reply (command envelopes, agenda, calendar).

## WORKFLOW

* just check / tree / agenda / serve / test — recipes handle PLTUSERHOME +
  raco link (`run`/`watch` alias `serve`). Racket comes from the nix dev
  shell (nixpkgs 9.2). Don't fight raco setup; PLTUSERHOME must be writable.
* Branch and PR for EVERY change, agents included: work on a branch, small
  commits one concern each, open a PR against master, CI green before it
  merges. Never push to master directly — branch protection refuses it.
* Other agents work this repo concurrently (Grok in a kolu terminal). git pull
  --rebase before starting, and rebase the branch on master before the PR;
  don't assume a clean tree is yours.
* Driving that terminal: `padi-tui status` lists terminals + agent state;
  `padi-tui wait <id> --until awaiting,waiting` blocks until its turn ends.
  `kaval-tui snapshot <id>` reads the screen; to prompt it: `kaval-tui send
  <id> "text"`, pause ~2s, then `kaval-tui send <id> --key Enter` (separate
  sends — same-breath Enter gets eaten by the paste debounce). Long briefs:
  write a file, send a short "read <path>" prompt. Never kill that terminal.
* CI = nix build + binary smoke + just test. Keep `nix build` offline-clean
  when possible; external racket deps (gregor, markdown) need vendoring or
  impure install until fixed-output derivations land.
* Tests parse JSON output with read-json. Never string-match JSON.

## VOICE

* README/docs: terse, dry, 90s hacker. No emoji, no badges, no marketing.
