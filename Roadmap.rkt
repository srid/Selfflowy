Selfflowy roadmap #project
  : Weekend-sized phases; every phase leaves the tool usable.
  : git log is the real changelog.
  Done
    : Landed, pushed, verified.
    [x] 0.1 the language
      : The s-exp core, then the quoteless outline syntax took the flagship
      : name (selfflowy/sexp keeps the old form). Strict 2-space indent,
      : verbatim titles, ": " notes, @date fields, inline #tags, closed
      : grammar, srcloc'd errors agents can act on.
    [x] 0.2a dates
      : @date with ISO date or datetime (gregor); `selfflowy agenda` groups
      : overdue / today / upcoming.
    [x] 0.3 capture
      : `selfflowy add` appends under Inbox, re-validates before keeping the
      : write, auto-commits. Bind it to a hotkey.
    [x] agent-first CLI
      : Agents are the primary users: --json everywhere (version key,
      : append-only fields), exit-code contract, errors as JSON. docs/cli.md
      : is the contract. Multi-file paths; merged agenda.
    [x] html view
      : `selfflowy html` — Tailwind + details/summary, Markdown in titles and
      : notes (render-time only). Terminal renderer retired; tree is JSON-only.
      : (Superseded: the html command died when `selfflowy serve` arrived.)
    [x] done status
      : `@done` / `[x]` sugar, `#:done` in the core, agenda exclusion, checked
      : HTML rendering, `selfflowy done TITLE` with add-style write safety.
    [x] 0.2b.1 mirrors (in-file)
      : ^anchor / *anchor; #:id + (mirror); cycle rejection; JSON mirror refs +
      : anchors index; agenda dedupe; html permalinks; done/add accept ^anchor.
    [x] @include composition + daily rollover
      : @include require+splice; Daily/YYYY-MM.rkt fragments; selfflowy daily; write-path routes to defining file.
    [x] 0.8 calendar
      : Agenda, month grid in html (links to Daily day nodes), move, ics.
      : (Grid view later retired with the html command; query/move/ics live.)
  0.2b.2 cross-file mirrors
    : Link anchors across outline files (not yet).
  glob includes
    : `@include Daily/*.rkt` -- one line instead of a line per month.
    : The sugar has to answer: match order (lexicographic; date-named
    : fragments sort right), zero matches (empty or error?), and flat
    : splice vs structure (Daily.rkt's year > month nesting comes from
    : the index file's own nodes; a flat glob erases it). Mechanically
    : easy: the reader expands the glob at read time, the module graph
    : stays static per load, the watcher already re-reads the include
    : set.
  typed edges
    : The graph beyond containment (the Tend thesis). Tree stays the
    : spanning structure -- every node has one defining site; any other
    : relation is a typed reference to an anchor: `@after ^x`,
    : `@blocks ^y`, `@see ^z`. The linker resolves triples
    : (relation source-key target-key), rejects dangling refs with
    : srclocs, and enforces acyclicity PER RELATION (after: yes, with
    : cycle-path errors; see: cycles are fine). Store snapshot carries
    : per-relation adjacency + topo caches; queries are pure functions
    : (blocked = unfinished @after targets; project = reachable
    : subgraph). JSON gains an edges index beside anchors. Rides on the
    : 0.2b.2 linker; task-key is the node identity.
  0.4 the agent ^web-agent
    : Minimal HTTP server with a chat panel driving Claude Code over ACP,
    : plus the outline served live. Talk to your outline from any browser.
    : Built with 0.5 as one push; Opus subagents implement, Fable reviews.
    [x] WP1 serve skeleton
      : `selfflowy serve` + routes (/, /api/tree, /api/agenda, /static/*);
      : nix run; just run/watch. Byte-identical JSON to the CLI.
    WP4 ACP bridge
      : Spawn claude-agent-acp subprocess (bypass-permissions), stdio
      : JSON-RPC, session lifecycle, chat SSE events, fake-agent tests.
    WP5 chat panel
      : Panel fragment, POST /chat, streamed text + tool-call lines.
    WP6 integration
      : Final wiring, headless CI smoke (boot, curl, file-change, SSE).
  0.5 the outline ^web-outline
    : Real read-mostly web view: collapse, zoom, breadcrumbs; SSE pushes
    : updates when files change (agent edits appear live).
    [x] WP2 renderers + skin
      : render.rkt fragment functions; Workflowy-faithful CSS (no
      : Tailwind); vendored htmx+sse; localStorage collapse.
    WP2.5 review fixes
      : Dual-lens (Hickey/Lowy) review output, adjudicated.
      @done 2026-08-04
      store layer
        : Snapshot + fresh-namespace reload; last-good + error banner;
        : include set for the watcher; derived index cached.
        @done 2026-08-04
      stable node keys
        : task-key from anchor or file+ordinal -- rename-safe permalinks,
        : collapse state, swap targets; no sibling collisions.
        @done 2026-08-04
      shared write path
        : apply-outline-edit! safe in a persistent server; CLI + web.
        @done 2026-08-04
      seams & dedup
        : /today route (fixes 404), render-file-section, today required,
        : collapse.js static, one owner for ids/assets/palette/tags.
        @done 2026-08-04
    WP3 SSE + watcher
      : /events hub; filesystem-change-evt debounce; outline-changed
      : fragment re-swaps; midnight re-render.
  0.6 micro-edits
    : Capture box + check-off from the browser (done status already in the
    : language + CLI). The phone loop closes: capture, complete, ask the
    : agent for everything else.
  0.7 PWA
    : Manifest + service worker; offline reading, background-sync capture
    : queue.
  0.9 search
    : Text search + keyboard nav in the web view.
  \@doc documents
    : Expand a node into a full document: a @doc field attaches a file,
    : rendered inline when the node is zoomed; one-line preview collapsed.
    : Two tiers by extension: .md (default; agents are fluent) and .scrbl
    : (Scribble for code-heavy power docs — real sections, highlighted code,
    : cross-refs). Documents stay files: greppable, diffable, editable by
    : $EDITOR and agents, includable elsewhere.
  doing status
    : A third state between open and done: `[~]` title sugar + `@doing`
    : field (#:doing in the core), same desugar rules as [x]/@done.
    : Rendered distinctly (pulsing/slanted pill); agenda gains a DOING
    : group above TODAY; `selfflowy doing TITLE|^anchor` flips it with
    : the usual write safety; done clears doing. Would have replaced the
    : "In progress" prose notes this roadmap has been faking.
  1.0 daily driver
    : When the author stops opening Workflowy.
  refactor pass ^pre-squash
    : Structural cleanups batched together, done just prior to the
    : workflow reset's squash of master into one root commit.
    core review fixes
      : Adjudicated dual-lens pass over lang/ + core: keys minted per
      : DEFINING file in the load layer (entry-point independent); one
      : line-grammar owner consumed by all mutators; one metadata-edit
      : engine + one TITLE|^anchor resolver + ops layer (CLI = shell);
      : core->web edge cut (file-label); one graph checker with srclocs
      : kept under @include; one fold-tasks walker; single owners for
      : counts/ics envelope. Then: status derivation, JSON version split,
      : keyword task constructor.
      @done 2026-08-04
    contracts at the seams
      : Make contract-out the policy for module boundaries (store, outline
      : struct, render exports, apply-outline-edit!): blame-assigned,
      : srcloc'd runtime errors agents can act on. Typed Racket at most
      : for pure leaf modules, never lang/. CLAUDE.md one-liner on adopt.
      @done 2026-08-04
    mirror resolution out of the render walk
      : A resolve pass outside web/ producing already-bound nodes (plus
      : mirror-of markers); render just draws. Deferred from the
      : dual-lens review; also what 0.2b.2 cross-file mirrors needs.
      @done 2026-08-04
    shrink the CLI
      : Once the web app is the daily surface, retire the human-facing
      : CLI commands; the CLI remains as the agent tool surface and
      : write-safety layer.
  architecture as data
    : Half-mechanize the Hickey/Lowy lenses: each module carries an `arch`
    : submodule declaring its volatility clock and owned ambient
    : authorities (wall-clock, filesystem, subprocess); a ~100-line raco
    : check walks module->imports and enforces (a) dependencies point
    : volatile -> stable only, (b) authorities used only where owned,
    : (c) declared concept exclusivity on tagged exports. CI-run. Bonus:
    : diff declared clocks against git-churn and flag lies. "The expander
    : is the only validator", applied to the codebase's own shape. Human/
    : agent review shifts to auditing declarations and naming new
    : concepts. Only worth the CHECKED subset -- declarations rot like
    : comments otherwise.
  workflow reset
    : After the web app lands, squash master into one root commit; then branch protection + PRs with required CI and review for all changes (agents included); CLAUDE.md workflow rules rewritten to match; changelog moves out of git log.
