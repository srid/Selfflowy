# selfflowy CLI — agent contract

Agents are the primary users. Prefer `--json`. Fields within a `version` are
**append-only**; a bump of `version` is a breaking change.

**Human view is the web app** (`selfflowy/web`). There is no ANSI terminal
tree and no static HTML export. Agents use `tree` / `check` / `agenda --json`.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | success |
| 1 | usage: unknown command, bad flags, missing TITLE, a malformed `--date` / `--month` / `--port` |
| 2 | the outline said no: load or validation error, no such task, ambiguous title, already done, a write aimed at a `#lang selfflowy/sexp` file |
| 3 | file not found |

Same codes for plain and `--json` modes. The write commands know nothing about
exit codes: an op (`selfflowy/ops`) fails with a KIND — usage, validation,
not-found — and the CLI maps the kind to a code. The codes are the contract;
the kinds are how the layer below talks about failure.

## Global

- Default outline file when no paths given:
  `$SELFFLOWY_HOME/Tasks.rkt` (default home:
  `~/Dropbox/Selfflowy-Srid`). `add` / `done` / `move` always target one file
  via `--file`, same default.
- **Read commands** (`check` / `tree` / `agenda` / `calendar` / `ics` /
  `serve`) accept **one or more** outline paths. The justfile defaults to
  `$SELFFLOWY_HOME/*.rkt` (no `examples/` paths). `serve` also takes the
  DIRECTORY and globs it itself — that is its front door, see below.
- Personal data lives outside the repo. Override the directory with
  `SELFFLOWY_HOME`. Auto-commit (`add` / `done` / `move` / `daily`) only runs
  when the directory of the file actually written is a git work tree;
  otherwise it no-ops (`committed: false`) and Dropbox (or your sync) is the history layer.
- `--json` may appear after the subcommand where supported.

## `check [--json] [file ...]`

Validate `#lang selfflowy` or `#lang selfflowy/sexp` module(s).

Plain — one ok-line per file; if any fail, all are reported then exit 2.
Anchor / mirror / include counts are appended only when non-zero:

```console
$ selfflowy check examples/Example.rkt examples/Daily.rkt
ok: .../Example.rkt (12 tasks, 1 anchor, 1 mirror)
ok: .../Daily.rkt (18 tasks, 2 anchors, 1 mirror, 2 includes)
```

JSON — **single file** keeps the historical shape:

```json
{"version":1,"ok":true,"file":".../Example.rkt","tasks":12,"anchors":1,"mirrors":1}
```

`tasks` counts each defining node once (mirrors do not inflate the count).
`anchors` / `mirrors` are counts of `^id` declarations and `*id` sites. A file
that splices `@include` fragments also carries `includes` — absent, not empty,
when there are none:

```json
{"version":1,"ok":true,"file":".../IncludeRoot.rkt","tasks":6,"anchors":1,
 "mirrors":1,"includes":[{"file":".../IncludeFrag.rkt"}]}
```

**Multiple files**:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ok": false,
  "files": [
    {"file":".../Example.rkt","ok":true,"tasks":12,"anchors":1,"mirrors":1},
    {"file":".../bad.rkt","ok":false,
     "error":{"file":".../bad.rkt","line":4,"col":8,"message":"..."}}
  ]
}
```

Top-level `ok` is false if any file failed. Per-file errors ride in the array
on **stdout** and nothing goes to stderr — the single-file shape is the one
that reports on stderr (see *Errors*). Exit is still 2.

## `tree [--json] [file ...]`

**Always JSON** (the task forest). `--json` is accepted as a no-op for compat.
Humans should use the web app.

Single file:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "file": ".../Example.rkt",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Inbox #capture",
      "date": null,
      "description": "Quick capture landing zone",
      "done": null,
      "status": "open",
      "id": null,
      "key": "pd076e677",
      "tags": ["capture"],
      "children": [ ... ]
    }
  ],
  "anchors": { "agent": { "title": "Agent work", "id": "agent", "key": "agent",
                          "children": [] } },
  "task_count": 12,
  "mirror_count": 1,
  "anchor_count": 1
}
```

Mirror sites in `children` are `{"mirror":"agent"}` — never an inlined subtree.
The `anchors` object holds each anchored node once (same shape as a task).

A root that splices `@include` fragments also carries `includes`
(`[{"file":"..."}]`, absent when there are none), and every node whose
**defining** file differs from the loaded file carries its own `file` — that is
where writes go (see *Write routing under `@include`*).

Multiple files:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "files": [
    {"file":".../Example.rkt","tasks":[...],"anchors":{...},
     "task_count":12,"mirror_count":1,"anchor_count":1},
    {"file":".../Daily.rkt","tasks":[...],"anchors":{...},
     "task_count":18,"mirror_count":1,"anchor_count":2,
     "includes":[{"file":".../Daily/2026-07.rkt"},{"file":".../Daily/2026-08.rkt"}]}
  ]
}
```

`date` / `description` are raw strings or `null` (Markdown is not interpreted
here). `done` is the stored field: `null` (open), `true` (completed, no
timestamp), or an ISO timestamp string. `status` is what that field MEANS —
`"open"` or `"done"` — and is the one to switch on: it is where a future
state would show up, while `done` keeps its type. `id` is `null` or the anchor
string. `tags` is always an array.

`key` is the node's stable identity — its `^anchor` when it has one, else a
hash of its **defining** file plus the child ordinals that reach it inside
that file. Only the anchor case comes from the expander (a module sees one
entry point and would key a spliced node twice); the rest are minted by the
load layer, over the whole set of files you loaded, at once. A key survives
renaming the node or any ancestor and cannot collide between same-titled
siblings; it changes when siblings are reordered (anchor the node if you need
more). Because the file is the one that DEFINES the node, an `@include`d node
keys the same through any root that includes it, and two roots sharing a
fragment agree about it.

The file's name inside that hash is its path **relative to the common
directory of the loaded set** — so two roots named `Daily.rkt` in different
directories do not collide, and moving the whole outline home does not re-key
it. The corollary is that the base moves with the set: load a nested fragment
as its own root and its label re-bases, so its nodes key differently than they
do under the root that includes them.

```console
$ selfflowy tree examples/Daily.rkt           # "Setup day" -> p8cfece7b
$ selfflowy tree examples/Daily/2026-08.rkt   # "Setup day" -> p3dd3c447
```

Load the files you always load (`serve` keys against the set it was given) and
keys are stable. The web view addresses nodes by this key (element ids,
permalinks, stored collapse state).

## `agenda [--json] [file ...]`

Dated tasks relative to local today, **merged across all given files**. **Done
tasks are excluded** even if they still have a `@date`. When more than one file
is given, breadcrumbs are rooted at each file's basename
(`Tasks.rkt > Inbox > Buy milk`). Plain mode is unstyled text. Empty groups are
omitted in plain mode, and an agenda with nothing in it prints `no dated tasks`;
JSON always includes all three arrays (possibly empty).

Plain:

```text
OVERDUE
  [2026-01-15T08:00]  Buy milk
         Tasks.rkt > Inbox > Buy milk
```

JSON stdout:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "today": "2026-08-03",
  "overdue": [{"title":"...","date":"2026-01-15T08:00","breadcrumb":"..."}],
  "today_items": [],
  "upcoming": []
}
```

## `calendar [--json] [--month YYYY-MM] [file ...]`

Group **dated** tasks by calendar day for one month (default: current).
**Done tasks are included** (JSON `done` is `true` or a timestamp, `status` is
`"done"`). Days that
have a bare-ISO day node in Daily-style outlines set `day_node: true` (for
web deep-links). Multi-file merge like agenda.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "month": "2026-08",
  "days": [
    {
      "date": "2026-08-04",
      "day_node": true,
      "items": [
        {"title":"Buy milk","date":"2026-08-04T18:00","breadcrumb":"...","done":null,
         "status":"open","id":null}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## `serve [--port N] [--bind ADDR] [DIR | file ...]`

Run the web view over an outline directory. Blocks until Ctrl-C, which shuts
the listener down cleanly.

**A DIRECTORY is the front door** — one argument that is a directory, or no
argument at all, which means `$PWD`. The roots are that directory's `*.rkt` at
the **top level only** (`@include` fragments live in subdirectories, so a
recursive walk would load every one of them twice), sorted, so the node keys
minted against the set are stable. The glob is evaluated once at startup: a new
top-level file is picked up by restarting, not while running. A directory with
no `*.rkt` in it is refused, naming the directory, exit 3. `just serve` is this
form over `$SELFFLOWY_HOME`.

The agent runs **in that directory** — exactly it, not the base derived from
the files. That is the point of the form: Claude Code keys its stored sessions
by the directory it was started in, so a stable one is what makes "the session
you were last in" a thing that survives a restart (see *Sessions* below).

```console
$ selfflowy serve ~/Dropbox/Selfflowy-Srid
selfflowy serve http://127.0.0.1:8080 dir: /home/me/Dropbox/Selfflowy-Srid files: /.../Daily.rkt /.../Tasks.rkt
```

**Explicit `.rkt` files are the plumbing** — the roots are those files, and the
agent works from the directory they hang off (one file: its directory; several:
the deepest directory holding all of them, the base keys are minted against).

```console
$ selfflowy serve examples/Example.rkt
selfflowy serve http://127.0.0.1:8080 files: /.../examples/Example.rkt
```

- `--port N` — default `8080`. `0` binds a free port and logs which one.
- `--bind ADDR` — default `127.0.0.1`. `--bind ""` listens on all interfaces.
- **No auth.** The network is the auth: put it behind Tailscale or Caddy.

**`SELFFLOWY_ACP_AGENT`** is an absolute path to an executable that speaks the
[Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) on stdio; `serve`
spawns it as a subprocess. There is no fallback and no PATH lookup: with the
variable unset (or pointing at something that is not executable) the server
refuses to start. Nix sets it for you — `nix run` / `nix run .#serve` and the
dev shell (so `just serve`) default it to the bundled Claude Code adapter,
`packages.acp-agent` (`nix build .#acp-agent`), which is vendored from npm and
pinned, never fetched at run time. Exporting the variable yourself wins, which
is how you point `serve` at a different agent.

Unset, or pointing at a file that is missing or not executable, is a **usage
error**: nothing binds a port and the reason goes to stderr naming the
variable —

```console
$ selfflowy serve
selfflowy: SELFFLOWY_ACP_AGENT is not set; serve needs the path to an ACP agent (docs/cli.md)
$ SELFFLOWY_ACP_AGENT=/nope selfflowy serve
selfflowy: SELFFLOWY_ACP_AGENT does not exist: /nope
```

— exit 1, the usage code. The agent is spawned **at startup**, in a background
thread: the listener is up first, so pages serve while the subprocess starts
and the last conversation replays into them (see *Sessions*). A boot that fails
is an `error` frame and a log line, and the next chat message retries it — the
same path a crashed agent takes, which is likewise replaced on the next message.
Its stderr is a log sink, drained into the server's own stderr with an `acp:`
prefix; only its stdout is protocol. Chat frames ride `/events` under the `chat`
event name, one JSON object per event:
`{"type":"user","text"}`, `{"type":"chunk","text"}`,
`{"type":"tool","id","title","status"}` (the same `id` twice means the same
line, updated), `{"type":"done","stopReason","html"}` (`html` is the turn's
agent text rendered as Markdown), `{"type":"error","message"}`,
`{"type":"reset"}`, `{"type":"model","name"}`,
`{"type":"commands","commands":[{"name","description"}]}`,
`{"type":"session","id","title"}`. New keys may appear;
existing ones keep their meaning.

The `model` frame is which model the session is running, and it is the agent's
word for it — said two ways, because one is not enough. The adapter reports the
**picked** model as a session config option (`configOptions`, the entry with id
`model`), once in the `session/new` result and again in a
`config_option_update` whenever it changes under a live session. But a `/model`
slash command is handled inside the wrapped Claude Code CLI: the adapter never
sees it as a config change, so `configOptions` go on naming the model the
session started on. The **running** model is in the CLI's own `system`/`init`
message, which the adapter forwards verbatim as a `_claude/sdkMessage`
notification — to a client that asked, for the kinds it asked for, which is why
`session/new` carries
`_meta.claudeCode.emitRawSDKMessages = [{"type":"system","subtype":"init"}]`.
Only the `model` field of it is read.

Whichever source moved last wins, and each is debounced against its own
previous value: the picker resends its whole set whenever anything in it moves,
and the running model repeats every turn. The first running model is a baseline
(it agrees with the config option) and is not announced twice. A running model
the picker offers is labelled with the picker's name; one it does not offer is
shown raw and named once in the log — truthful, where a guess would not be. An
agent that never says leaves the header alone; nothing is inferred from a
command line or a version, and an agent that is not the Claude Code adapter
ignores the `_meta` and loses nothing.

The `commands` frame is the agent's slash commands — the adapter pushes the
whole list as an `available_commands_update` (`availableCommands`, each entry
`{name, description, input}`) just after `session/new`, and again whenever the
set moves under a live session. The bridge keeps the names and descriptions,
drops `input` (an argument hint the panel does not draw), and pushes a frame
only when the list actually changed. A command is INVOKED as ordinary prompt
text — `/name arguments` in a `POST /chat` — so nothing else on the wire knows
about them.

### Sessions

An agent that keeps its conversations keys them by the directory it was started
in — which is why `serve DIR` runs it in exactly that directory. So there is a
LAST session, and the server comes up in it:

- After `initialize`, if the agent advertises `loadSession` and
  `sessionCapabilities.list`, the bridge asks `session/list` for that directory
  and **adopts the most recently updated** session with `session/load`. Nothing
  stored, or an agent that advertises neither: `session/new`, as before.
- `session/load` **replays the whole conversation** as `session/update`
  notifications and only then answers. The replay has no live turn and nothing
  in it says where one turn ended, so the bridge reconstructs them from the one
  boundary it has: a `user_message_chunk` opens a turn, agent chunks and tool
  calls fill it, the next user message closes it. Replayed turns land in the
  transcript in the same shape as lived ones, and go out as the same frames —
  `user`, `chunk`, `tool`, `done` — so open tabs fill in as they arrive. Their
  `stopReason` is **null**: a replay does not carry how a turn ended, and
  `end_turn` would be a guess.
- The `session` frame is which conversation this is. It goes out when a session
  is established (new, adopted, or picked) and again when its title moves — the
  agent writes the title in the background and pushes it as a
  `session_info_update` (which also carries `updatedAt`; only the title is
  read). `title` is null until there is one, so a fresh session says its id
  first and its name later. The panel header shows the title, quietly, beside
  the model.
- `+ new` still means `session/new`: the agent-side context goes away, a
  `session` frame names the new one, and a `reset` clears the panels.

The picker is two routes. `GET /chat/sessions` asks the agent every time (its
list is the only one that is right):

```json
{"sessions":[{"id":"…","title":"Investigate the crash",
              "updatedAt":"2026-08-05T14:41:21.471Z","current":true}]}
```

Newest first; `title` / `updatedAt` may be `null`; `current` marks the one the
server is in. `POST /chat/load` (form field `id`) moves to one: `204`, then a
`reset`, the replayed turns, and the `session` frame on `/events`, so every open
tab repopulates. `409` while a turn is running or another load is in flight;
`503` when the agent is gone or does not keep sessions. The load is not a turn —
it does not appear in the transcript as one, and the transcript it replaces is
dropped, because a transcript of a session you are no longer in is a lie.

A turn is accepted (and its `user` frame pushed) before the subprocess exists,
so a cancel can arrive during the handshake. It is remembered and sent as soon
as the prompt is on the wire: every cancelled turn ends the same way, a `done`
frame whose `stopReason` the agent chose (`cancelled` from a Claude Code
adapter).

Routes:

| Route | Body |
|-------|------|
| `GET /` | HTML page (Workflowy-style skin from `selfflowy/web/render.rkt`) |
| `GET /today` | the first node titled with today's ISO date (the Daily day node), zoomed; terse empty state when there is none yet |
| `GET /events` | `text/event-stream`, never ends. `event: outline` with the store revision as its data whenever a watched file reloaded, plus one at local midnight; `event: chat` with one JSON frame from the agent per line; a `:hb` comment on connect and every 15s after, so a client knows it is subscribed and proxies leave it alone |
| `POST /chat` | prompt the agent; form field `text` (empty after trimming is `400`). `204` — what the panel draws comes back over `/events`, so every open tab stays in step. `409` with a terse `text/plain` body while a turn is running, `503` when the agent is gone |
| `POST /chat/new` | new chat: the agent-side context goes away, `204`, and a `reset` frame clears every panel |
| `POST /chat/cancel` | cancel the turn in flight, `204` (also while the agent is still booting); the `done` frame (`stopReason` `cancelled`) follows on its own |
| `GET /chat/sessions` | the agent's stored conversations for this directory, JSON (see *Sessions*); `503` while the agent is gone |
| `POST /chat/load` | load one of them; form field `id` (missing is `400`). `204` — the reset, the replayed turns and the `session` frame come back over `/events`. `409` while a turn or another load is running, `503` when the agent is gone |
| `GET /api/tree` | byte-identical to `selfflowy tree` |
| `GET /api/agenda` | byte-identical to `selfflowy agenda --json` |
| `GET /static/*` | files under `selfflowy/web/static/` |
| anything else | `404`, terse `text/plain` |

A node's permalink is `/#n-<key>` (`key` as in `tree` JSON). Anchored nodes and
bare-ISO day nodes also keep a plain `#<anchor>` / `#<YYYY-MM-DD>` target, so
links people wrote by hand still resolve.

Paths that climb out of `static/` are 404, not files.

The chat panel (a `>_ agent` button, bottom right; open state remembered in
`localStorage`) is server-rendered from the bridge's transcript on every page
load — frames are ephemeral, so a reload or a second tab replays instead of
missing the conversation — and kept live by `static/chat.js` off the page's one
SSE connection. Its header names the model when the agent has reported one, and
the conversation when it has a title. The `chats` button beside `+ new` opens a
popover over `GET /chat/sessions` — newest first, the current one marked, ↑/↓
and Enter or a click to load one, Esc to close.
Agent text is Markdown at render time, same as titles and notes; what you typed
and a tool's title never are.

Typing `/` in the panel's input — or pressing the `/` button on the input row,
which shows the whole list — opens a completion popover over the agent's
slash commands (replayed onto the panel as `data-commands`, kept live by the
`commands` frame): ↑/↓ move, Enter or Tab accept the highlighted one into the
input, Esc closes, and Enter with nothing open sends the message as always.
Accepting only writes `/name ` — sending is what invokes it.

**Edits are pushed, and picked up on the next request either way.** The server
keeps a snapshot of the outlines (roots plus every `@include` fragment) and
reloads it when a watched file's mtime or size changes; a reload runs in a
fresh namespace, so the module registry cannot serve you yesterday's file. A
watcher holds a `filesystem-change-evt` on each watched file's *directory*
(saves are atomic renames, which fire there), debounces the flurry, and pushes
an `outline` event on `/events` when the store actually reloaded. Open pages
re-fetch themselves and swap the pane and the error banner — no refresh.

A file is broken for a moment during every edit, so the two surfaces differ:

- `/api/*` answers `500` with the JSON error object (same shape as `--json`
  errors, `file` / `line` / `col` / `message`) — agents never get stale data
  quietly.
- `/` keeps rendering the **last good** snapshot and puts the error, with its
  `file:line:col`, in a banner at the top of the page. With no last-good
  snapshot (the first load failed) it answers `500` with the same banner.

A broken file pushes an event too — the banner appearing IS the news — so the
revision moves on a failed reload as well as a good one. It is a counter, not
a version: compare it, do not parse it.

Exit codes: 0 on clean shutdown, 1 on bad flags, a port it cannot bind, or a
missing / unusable `SELFFLOWY_ACP_AGENT`; 3 when an outline path does not
exist, or a directory holds no top-level `*.rkt`.

There is no static HTML export — `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/ > snap.html`
if you want one.

## `add [--json] [--file F] [--date ISO] [--description TEXT] [--parent TITLE|^anchor] [--no-commit] TITLE...`

`--date` accepts `YYYY-MM-DD` or a datetime (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` / `…:SS`; a space
instead of `T` is fine).

Capture under a parent node: default top-level `Inbox` (created if missing), or
`--parent ^anchor` / `--parent TITLE`. Writes **outline** syntax only. TITLE
words join with spaces (no shell quoting required).

- Validates by re-loading after write; on failure restores the prior file.
- If the file's directory is a git work tree, auto-commits that file with
  message `capture: TITLE` unless `--no-commit`.
- Never prompts; never opens an editor.

Plain:

```console
$ selfflowy add --no-commit buy oat milk
added "buy oat milk" under Inbox in .../Tasks.rkt (line 12)
```

JSON stdout:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ok": true,
  "file": ".../Tasks.rkt",
  "title": "buy oat milk",
  "date": null,
  "description": null,
  "parent": null,
  "line": 12,
  "created_inbox": false,
  "committed": false
}
```

`parent` echoes `--parent` verbatim (`null` for the default Inbox). `file` is
the file actually written — with `--parent ^anchor` that may be an `@include`
fragment, not `--file`.

## `done [--json] [--file F] [--undo] [--no-commit] TITLE...|^anchor`

Mark a task done by exact title match or `^anchor` (or undo). **One file only**
(`--file`). Writes **outline** syntax only — same safety as `add`: write temp →
re-validate → rename; restore on failure.

- Exact title match across the file (a `[x] ` checkbox prefix and a trailing
  `^anchor` are not part of the matched title), or a single `^id` addressing
  the defining site.
- **0 matches** → exit 2.
- **>1 matches** → exit 2; message lists each `file:line` and suggests
  `add a ^anchor to disambiguate`.
- On success: inserts `@done YYYY-MM-DD` (today) after the task's metadata,
  preserving the rest of the file. Rejects tasks already done.
- `--undo`: remove `@done` metadata and strip a leading `[x] ` / `[X] ` prefix.
- Auto-commit `done: TITLE` / `undone: TITLE` in a git work tree unless
  `--no-commit`.

Plain:

```console
$ selfflowy done --no-commit Buy milk
done "Buy milk" in .../Tasks.rkt (line 5)
```

JSON stdout:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ok": true,
  "file": ".../Tasks.rkt",
  "title": "Buy milk",
  "line": 5,
  "done": "2026-08-03",
  "undone": false,
  "committed": false
}
```

On `--undo`, `done` is `null` and `undone` is `true`.

## `move [--json] [--file F] [--no-commit] [--clear] TITLE...|^anchor DATE`

Set or rewrite `@date` on a task (same write-safety as `add`/`done`). `DATE`
is ISO date or datetime. `--clear` removes `@date` instead (no DATE arg).
Auto-commit message: `move: TITLE -> DATE` (or cleared).

```json
{"version":1,"ok":true,"file":"...","title":"Buy milk","line":6,"date":"2026-08-10","committed":false}
```

With `--clear`, `date` is `null`. `title` is always the node's resolved title,
never the raw `^anchor` you passed.

## `ics [--out PATH] [file ...]`

RFC 5545 `VCALENDAR` of all dated tasks (done included). Minimal writer —
no catalog ics package. UID is `anchor@selfflowy` when present, else a
stable hash of path/title/date. `DTSTART` is `VALUE=DATE` or local datetime.

## `daily [--json] [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--home DIR] [--no-commit]`

Ensure a day node exists in the personal Daily structure under `$SELFFLOWY_HOME`
(or `--home`):

- Fragment: `Daily/YYYY-MM.rkt` (day nodes only at top level)
- Root: `Daily.rkt` with `year > MonthName > @include Daily/YYYY-MM.rkt`

Creates the month fragment and `@include` line on first use in a month;
idempotent thereafter. Writes use add-style validate-then-rename, and
auto-commit like the other write commands — the fragment and the root that
includes it in ONE commit (`daily: YYYY-MM-DD`).

```json
{"version":1,"ok":true,"day":"2026-08-04","file":".../Daily/2026-08.rkt",
 "created_month":true,"created_day":true,"line":2,"committed":true}
```

Both `created_*` are `false` on every run after the first for that day, and
`committed` is `false` when there was nothing to write (or `--no-commit`).

## Write routing under `@include`

`done` / `move` / `add --parent ^anchor` resolve the target against the loaded
tree (including fragments), then edit the **defining file** of that node.
JSON `file` fields on tree nodes show where agents should write.

## Errors (`--json`)

Single object on **stderr**, exit non-zero:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "file": ".../Tasks.rkt",
    "line": 4,
    "col": 2,
    "message": "..."
  }
}
```

`line` / `col` / `file` are `null` when not applicable — a load failure carries
all three (and repeats them as a `file:line:col` prefix in `message`), a
"you asked for something that is not there" failure names the file only:

```json
{"version":1,"ok":false,
 "error":{"file":".../Tasks.rkt","line":null,"col":null,
          "message":"\"Wire the CLI\" is already done (line 16)"}}
```

`message` is addressed to a person, not to a stack: no `some-private-function:`
prefix in front of the answer. Agents must not regex pretty-printed messages.

## Stability

- Two counters, both `1` today and free to move apart: the **model** version
  rides on `tree` payloads (what a node/tree/anchor IS), the **reply** version
  on command envelopes (`ok` / `error`, `agenda`, `calendar`, the write
  commands) — a new node field bumps the first, a reshaped envelope the second.
- Top-level objects always include `"version": 1`.
- Within v1, new keys may appear; existing keys keep meaning and type.
- Removing or renaming a key requires a version bump.

## Nix build note

Runtime deps (`gregor`, `markdown`) and nixpkgs are pinned with **npins**
(`npins/sources.json`). `nix build` is fully offline/sandboxed.
