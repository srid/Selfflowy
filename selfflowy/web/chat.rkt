;; The conversation with the agent: one turn at a time, one transcript, one
;; stream of chat frames.
;;
;; selfflowy/acp speaks the protocol and says what it heard (typed events, one
;; handler); this module is the only thing that listens, and what it makes of
;; them is a CHAT: what a browser is shown, in what order, and what a browser
;; that arrives late is shown instead. No JSON-RPC method name appears below.
;;
;; What this owns, and why:
;;
;;   * one turn at a time. ACP would queue; a chat panel does not want a queue,
;;     and a second prompt while the agent is talking is a conflict the caller
;;     has to see — exn:fail:op with kind 'busy, the same vocabulary the write
;;     ops use (the CLI maps kinds to exit codes, a route maps them to statuses).
;;   * the transcript. Frames are ephemeral — a browser that connects late
;;     missed them — so a turn is also accumulated here, and that is what a
;;     page load replays.
;;   * what a header SAYS: which model, which slash commands, which
;;     conversation. Each of those is learned from the agent and pushed only
;;     when it actually moved, so a session that re-announces the same model on
;;     every turn says nothing.
;;   * reassembling a replayed conversation into turns, which the wire does not
;;     hand over as turns.
;;
;; Threads: the caller's (prompt / cancel / reset / load / stop), the client's
;; (every event arrives on one of its), one per TURN waiting for the prompt to
;; come back, one per LOAD. Every state change takes `sema`, and a frame is
;; broadcast while it is held, so the order a browser sees is the order the
;; transcript records. Nothing here holds `sema` around a blocking call into the
;; client, and the client never delivers an event holding a lock of its own:
;; between the two, neither can wait on the other.
;;
;; Chat frames and transcript entries are append-only, same discipline as
;; json/reply: new keys may appear, existing ones keep their meaning and type.

;;
;; `sent?` is whether the prompt is on the wire yet. A turn is accepted long

;; client's idea of which session the next prompt names: the client forgets one
;; the instant it starts making the next, and what a header says catches up when
;; there is something true to say.
;;
;; `cust` is what the turn and load threads are created under: a prompt arrives
;; on an HTTP request's thread, and the web server shuts that connection's
;; custodian down as soon as the response is written — which would take the turn
;; with it the moment the 204 went out.

;;   {"type":"error","message"}               the turn ended badly

;;   {"type":"session","id","title"}          which stored conversation this
;;                                            is: pushed when a session is

;; ---- replaying a loaded session ---------------------------------------------
;;
;; A loaded conversation arrives as the same events a lived one does, between
;; a start and an end, and nothing in them says where one turn ended — so the
;; turns are reconstructed here, from the only boundary the replay has: a user
;; message.
;;
;; The rule is one line long. A user chunk is BUFFERED (a prompt can arrive as
;; several content blocks); the first agent chunk or tool call after it opens
;; the turn with what was buffered, and the next user chunk closes it. The last
;; turn is closed when the replay ends.
;;
;; What comes out is a turn of the same shape a lived one has, so the panel,
;; the page and the transcript need to know nothing about any of this — with
;; one honest difference: `stopReason` is null. The replay does not carry how a
;; turn ended, and "end_turn" would be this module's word, not the agent's.

;; The transcript of a conversation that is no longer the conversation would be
;; a lie, and the panels showing it have to be cleared before the replay starts
;; filling them again.
