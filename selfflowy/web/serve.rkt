;; The read-mostly web view.
;;
;;   GET  /             the html page: sidebar + outline + chat panel
;;   GET  /today        today's Daily day node, zoomed
;;   GET  /events       SSE stream; `outline` (data: store revision) per reload,
;;                      `chat` (data: one JSON frame) per agent frame
;;   POST /chat         prompt the agent (form field `text`) -> 204
;;   POST /chat/new     new chat -> 204
;;   POST /chat/cancel  cancel the turn in flight -> 204
;;   GET  /chat/sessions the agent's stored conversations, as JSON
;;   POST /chat/load    load one of them (form field `id`) -> 204
;;   GET  /api/tree     byte-identical to `selfflowy tree`
;;   GET  /api/agenda   byte-identical to `selfflowy agenda --json`
;;   GET  /static/*     files from web/static/
;;   anything else      404, terse text/plain
;;
;; No auth: the network is the auth (Tailscale / Caddy in front of it).
;; Routing, static files, and MIME types come from racket web-server. Outline
;; content comes from selfflowy/store — this module owns routes and responses,
;; never a load.
;;
;; Live updates are three parts that only meet here: the store knows WHAT the
;; outlines are, the watcher knows WHEN they moved, the hub knows WHO is
;; listening. None of them knows about the other two. The agent conversation
;; (web/chat, over selfflowy/acp) is a fourth of the same kind — it pushes
;; `chat` through the same hub and has never heard of HTTP; the /chat routes
;; below are the only place the two meet.
;;
;; The chat routes answer with a STATUS, never with content: what a panel
;; draws arrives over the stream, so every open tab shows the same
;; conversation whichever one typed into it.
