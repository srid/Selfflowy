;; The event hub: one push channel, many browsers.
;;
;; Server-Sent Events, not websockets: the traffic is one-way (the server
;; says "something moved"), EventSource reconnects by itself, and it is plain
;; HTTP so Caddy or Tailscale in front of it needs no configuration.
;;
;; The hub is GENERIC. It knows event names and payload strings and nothing
;; about outlines — the watcher broadcasts `outline`, the ACP bridge will
;; broadcast `chat`, and neither is spelled here.
;;
;; The rules a fan-out has to get right, and how this one does:
;;
;;   * a broadcast must never block on a slow reader. Each subscriber owns a
;;     BOUNDED async-channel and a put that would block drops the subscriber
;;     instead (see queue-limit) — its stream ends, its EventSource
;;     reconnects, and it gets a fresh full render, which is exactly the
;;     state a client that missed events wants anyway.
;;   * a subscriber whose connection died must go away. Two ways out: a
;;     failed write unsubscribes on the way past, and — because the server
;;     KILLS the response thread when a client hangs up, which runs no
;;     dynamic-wind — a subscriber whose owning thread is dead is pruned by
;;     the next broadcast.
;;   * an idle stream must not look dead to a proxy: a heartbeat comment
;;     goes out every heartbeat-seconds.
