;; The watcher: one thread that turns "a file moved" into one callback.
;;
;; It watches DIRECTORIES, not files. Every editor worth the name saves by
;; writing a temp file and renaming it over the target, and a rename fires on
;; the directory — a filesystem-change-evt held on the old inode would never
;; see it. Watching the parent also covers a watched file that does not exist
;; yet (a Daily fragment before the first capture of the month).
;;
;; The watch set is re-read every cycle, from the store's own snapshot, so an
;; edit that adds an @include starts watching the new fragment on the next
;; turn of the loop and nothing has to be restarted.
;;
;; This thread is allowed a clock — it is the shell layer, and the midnight
;; boundary is a real event: `today` grouping and the /today page go stale at
;; local midnight with no file having changed. The boundary ARITHMETIC is a
;; pure function of a moment (seconds-until-midnight), so it is testable
;; without waiting for one.
