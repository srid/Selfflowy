;; What the write commands DO, with no idea that a terminal exists.
;;
;; add / done / move / daily each used to be one CLI function that resolved,
;; edited, wrote, committed, decided an exit code and printed — so nothing
;; but a subprocess could call them, and `die` was reachable from the middle
;; of the logic. Here each op is a function from arguments to a result struct
;; (or an exn:fail:op naming what went wrong and how bad it is); cli.rkt turns
;; those into JSON, text and exit codes, and the web mutation routes will call
;; the same functions.
