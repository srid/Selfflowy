;; The snapshot layer.
;;
;; Outline files change per save (seconds); Racket's module registry caches a
;; loaded module for the life of the process (days). A server that loads once
;; serves yesterday's outline, and a mutation route would re-render the state
;; from BEFORE its own write. The store owns that mismatch:
;;
;;   * one current snapshot — the loaded outlines plus everything derived from
;;     them (render input, node index, merged anchors), computed once per load
;;     instead of once per request;
;;   * the transitive set of files the outlines are built from (roots plus
;;     @include fragments), which is what a watcher must watch;
;;   * last-good + current-error: a file is transiently broken during every
;;     edit, so a failed load keeps serving the last good snapshot and records
;;     the error instead of blanking the page.
;;
;; Reloads run in a FRESH namespace (the registry would otherwise hand back
;; the first version of the file forever). The expander is ATTACHED to that
;; namespace rather than re-instantiated, so the `task` struct type stays the
;; same value across reloads; outlines are compiled in this module's namespace
;; and only instantiated in the fresh one, which is what keeps reloading
;; working inside the `raco exe` binary (see compiling-load).
