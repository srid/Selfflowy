;; The ACP client, against a scripted agent (tests/fake-acp-agent.rkt): real
;; subprocess, real ndjson, no LLM. What is being checked here is the
;; PROTOCOL — what goes on the wire, what comes back, and the events the client
;; makes of it. What a browser then sees is tests/chat.rkt's business.
;;
;; Events are compared by name and payload, never by print form: they are
;; structs, and a test that matched their printing would be testing racket.
