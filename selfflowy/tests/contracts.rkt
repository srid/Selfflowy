;; The seams are contracted, and the blame is part of what they promise.
;;
;; A wrong value handed across a module boundary must name the CALLER — this
;; file — and the module whose contract it broke, with a srcloc an agent can
;; jump to. That is the difference between "expected string?, given 42" and a
;; regexp failing four frames deep inside someone else's regexp.
