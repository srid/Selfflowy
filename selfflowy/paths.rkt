;; What a file is CALLED. Core, not web: the store builds a node index out of
;; these and must not reach up into web/ for a basename.
;;
;;   file-label  what a human reads — the basename ("Daily.rkt").
;;   key-label   what a node's KEY is minted from: the defining file's path
;;               relative to the root set's common directory
;;               ("Daily/2026-08.rkt"). A basename would let two roots named
;;               Daily.rkt in different directories mint one key for two
;;               different nodes.
;;   dir-roots   which files a DIRECTORY contributes as roots.
